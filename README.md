# election-turnout-civic-tech

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the issue of low voter turnout. Many potential voters lack convenient transportation to get to a polling place. In fact, one 2016 [Harvard study](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi%3A10.7910%2FDVN%2FY38VIQ%2F2NJDL9&version=1.0) found that 14% of nonvoters said transportation was a "major factor" in why they did not vote in that election. This issue is of particular significance for low-income Americans, who are disproportionately Black, Latinx, Indigenous, immigrants, or LGBTQ; those in rural and suburban areas; and those who are elderly or disabled. Paired with oppressive restrictions on mail-in voting and the strategic shuttering of polling places in certain neighborhoods, this problem of lack of transportation creates the perfect storm of keeping some of the most vulnerable members of society from the ballot box.

## What it does
Our project connects a need to a solution. The need is transportation to the polls. Our solution is a web service that allows voters who need a ride to a polling place to view nearby volunteer drivers and request a ride **completely free of charge**. Additional functionality includes a form to allow volunteers to sign up to drive, an option to donate money, and a link to register to vote if the user had not done so previously.
